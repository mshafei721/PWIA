# PWIA Active Context

## Current Phase: Research → Plan

**Status**: Research phase COMPLETED ✅  
**Next**: Create detailed PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN for user approval

## Research Completed

### Repositories Analyzed:
1. ✅ CopilotKit - AI agent React framework
2. ✅ ChuanhuChatGPT - Multi-panel chat UI patterns  
3. ✅ AG-UI Protocol - Standardized agent communication
4. ✅ Computer Control Agent KB - Monitoring patterns
5. ✅ Multi-Agent Streamlit UI - Agent management patterns
6. ✅ Modern React Frameworks - Component libraries and state management

### Key Insights Discovered:
- CopilotKit provides perfect foundation for PWIA enhancement
- AG-UI Protocol can replace custom WebSocket implementation
- Shadcn UI + TanStack Query optimal for existing tech stack
- Multi-panel layout patterns validate current 3-pane approach
- Real-time streaming crucial for agent monitoring

## Current Task Focus

**Objective**: Create comprehensive PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN that is:
- Modular and granular
- Simple to implement in phases
- Based on research findings
- Follows Explore → Research → Plan → Approve → Implement workflow

## Immediate Next Actions

1. **Update PRD.md** with enhanced requirements based on research
2. **Create detailed PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN** with:
   - Modular phases with clear deliverables
   - Technical specifications for each component
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
   - Timeline and resource requirements
   - Success criteria and testing approaches

## Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1**: Foundation (CopilotKit + Basic Real-time)
**Phase 2**: Communication (AG-UI Protocol Integration)  
**Phase 3**: Enhancement (Shadcn UI + Advanced Features)
**Phase 4**: Optimization (Performance + Polish)

## Waiting For

User approval of the detailed implementation plan before beginning development work.
