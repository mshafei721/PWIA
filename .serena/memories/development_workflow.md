# Development Workflow and Guidelines

## PWIA Development Constitution (Critical Rules)

### Golden Principles
1. **Brilliant, amnesiac expert** - Always consult external memory files
2. **Never implement without user-approved plan** - No code without PLAN.md approval
3. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is mandatory
4. **PLAN.md is law** - No implementation outside checklist items
5. **Strict workflow**: Explore ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí User Approval ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Check/Test

### Workflow Stages

#### üîç Explore
- Ask: "What is the user trying to accomplish?"
- Ask targeted clarification questions if unclear

#### üìö Research  
- Examine all relevant files in memory-bank/, workspace/, and codebase
- Scan for existing tools, functions, or patterns that may help

#### üßæ Plan
- Break work into small, independently testable steps
- Update PLAN.md using strict checklist format
- Example format:
  ```markdown
  - [ ] Prompt: "Create the Pydantic model in `agent/memory.py`"
  - [ ] Prompt: "Write a failing test for the model"
  ```

#### ‚úÖ User Approval
- **HALT** until user approves updated PLAN.md
- Only begin executing after confirmation

#### üõ†Ô∏è Implement
- Perform only ONE checklist item at a time
- Save output to correct file path, not inline
- Update todo.md with timestamps on completed items

#### ‚úîÔ∏è Check / Test
- Run associated unit tests or create them
- Record results in todo.md
- Log confidence and learnings in LLM Reflection Notes

## Prohibited Behaviors
‚ùå Implementing outside PLAN.md  
‚ùå Modifying more than one file per task unless instructed  
‚ùå Using vague instructions (e.g., "make it look nicer")  
‚ùå Making assumptions without checking memory-bank/ first  
‚ùå Dumping large file content in chat  
‚ùå Trusting that "it runs" means "it works"

## Memory System Requirements
- All external memory in memory-bank/ directory
- PLAN.md contains checklist prompt plan (approved)
- activeContext.md tracks current task + focus
- progress.md tracks what's done, what's next
- workspace/<task_id>/todo.md for runtime task logs

## Workflow Shortcuts
| Keyword | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| ultrathink | Use maximum reasoning and plan multiple approaches |
| sub-task with agents | Break complex file changes into AI-agent subtasks |
| checkpoint | Commit progress in progress.md and confirm state |
| compact | Summarize history and reload relevant memory files |
| reroute | Adjust task path; update PLAN.md and todo.md |

## Session Management
### When You Begin a Session
1. Load all files from memory-bank/
2. Read CLAUDE.md to refresh behavior constraints  
3. Consult activeContext.md to know current focus
4. Use progress.md to understand what's already done
5. Prompt user: "Hello. I've reloaded the project memory. Based on PLAN.md, the next item is..."

### When You End a Session
1. Update activeContext.md with current task state
2. Update progress.md with completed/blocked/next items  
3. Confirm with user: "Would you like me to summarize or generate a compact version before closing?"

## Scope Restrictions
- All tools, libraries, and packages must be defined in memory-bank/techContext.md
- Do not introduce new third-party packages without user approval
- Follow defined system architecture from systemPatterns.md
