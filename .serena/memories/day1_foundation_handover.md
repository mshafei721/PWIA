# Day 1 Foundation - Conversation Handover Summary

## Status: Day 1 Task 1 COMPLETED ✅

### What Was Accomplished Today
Successfully completed the first implementation task from PLAN.md following the **Explore → Research → Plan → Execute → Check/Test** workflow.

**Task Completed**: "Create the complete PWIA project structure with directories: agent/, backend/, sandbox_vm/, app-memory/, workspace/, config/"

### Key Deliverables Created:

#### 1. Complete Directory Structure
- `agent/` - Python agent modules with `__init__.py`
- `backend/` - FastAPI server with `__init__.py`  
- `sandbox_vm/` - VM configuration directory
- `app-memory/` - Application memory system (NOT development memory-bank)
- `workspace/` - Task outputs directory
- `config/` - Configuration files
- `tests/` - Test structure with `agent/`, `backend/`, `e2e/` subdirectories

#### 2. Dependency Management Files
- **requirements.txt** - Complete Python dependencies researched from Context7
  - FastAPI, Uvicorn, WebSockets, Playwright, OpenAI, TinyDB, Pydantic, etc.
  - All versions verified against latest FastAPI documentation
- **Frontend/package.json** - Updated with modern framework dependencies
  - CopilotKit, Zustand, TanStack Query, Recharts, React Flow, Socket.io

#### 3. Development Environment Setup
- **setup.sh** - Automated virtual environment setup script
- **.gitignore** - Comprehensive exclusions for Python/Node.js/VM artifacts
- **Placeholder files** - .gitkeep files to maintain empty directory structure

### Research Integration Applied
- Used Context7 to get latest FastAPI documentation and best practices
- Followed FastAPI project structure recommendations from official docs
- Integrated research findings on CopilotKit, AG-UI Protocol, Shadcn UI

### Current State
- Project structure matches PRD.MD requirements exactly
- Ready for Backend API development (Day 2)
- All foundation files in place for TDD approach
- Dependencies researched and specified with proper versions

### Next Immediate Tasks (Day 2)
Based on PLAN.md, the next prompts to execute:

1. "Create backend/main.py with a basic FastAPI application including a health check endpoint at GET /health"
2. "Create backend/models.py with Pydantic models matching the task structure from Frontend/src/components/TaskDetailPanel.tsx lines 15-50"
3. "Add CORS middleware to backend/main.py to allow Frontend connections from http://localhost:5173"
4. "Create backend/routes/tasks.py with GET /tasks and GET /tasks/{task_id} endpoints returning mock data"
5. "Write tests in tests/test_api.py for all API endpoints"

### Important Notes for Next Developer
- **Follow CLAUDE.md workflow**: Always use Explore → Research → Plan → Execute → Check/Test
- **Use zen_mcp consensus**: Get consensus from multiple models before major decisions
- **Use serena_memory**: Reference memory files for context and progress tracking
- **Use context7**: Get latest documentation for any framework/library implementation
- **Update TodoWrite**: Track progress and mark tasks complete as they're finished
- **TDD Approach**: Write tests before implementation per CLAUDE.md requirements

### Files to Reference
- `/PLAN.md` - Complete implementation plan with detailed prompts
- `/PRD.MD` - Project requirements and architecture
- `memory-bank/progress.md` - Detailed progress tracking
- `memory-bank/research_synthesis_summary.md` - Research findings integration
- `Frontend/src/components/TaskDetailPanel.tsx` - For backend model structure

### Context: PWIA Project
Building a Persistent Web Intelligence Agent with:
- React Frontend (existing, needs backend connection)
- FastAPI Backend (being built)
- Python Agent with Playwright automation
- QEMU/KVM VM sandbox
- Real-time WebSocket communication
- Modern UI enhancements (CopilotKit, AG-UI Protocol, Shadcn UI)

The foundation is solid. Ready to build the backend API layer.
