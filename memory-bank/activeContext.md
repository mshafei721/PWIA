# Active Context: Modern Agent UI Frameworks Research for PWIA Enhancement

## Current Focus
Comprehensive research completed on modern React-based agent and AI interface frameworks for 2025, focusing on enhancing PWIA's current React+TypeScript+Tailwind stack with cutting-edge patterns and libraries.

## Research Scope
1. **Modern React UI Frameworks** - Shadcn UI, Material UI, Radix UI, Chakra UI, Next UI
2. **Real-time Communication Patterns** - WebSocket vs SSE, React Query, state management approaches
3. **Data Visualization Libraries** - Recharts, D3, Visx, react-chartjs-2 for agent monitoring
4. **Design Systems** - Tailwind-based systems, accessibility, dark theme support
5. **Performance Optimization** - Virtual scrolling, memoization, bundle optimization
6. **AI-Specific Frameworks** - CopilotKit integration recommendations

## Key Findings
- **Shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS** emerges as the optimal choice for PWIA's existing stack
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** recommended for agent progress streaming with WebSockets for bidirectional communication
- **Zustand + TanStack Query** combination provides optimal state management for real-time agent applications
- **Recharts** for simple visualizations, **Visx** for complex custom agent monitoring dashboards
- **Virtual scrolling** essential for handling large agent logs and data sets
- Modern React patterns in 2025 emphasize performance, accessibility, and real-time capabilities

## Research Outputs
- `modernAgentUIFrameworksResearch.md` - Comprehensive 8-section analysis with code examples and implementation roadmap
- Specific recommendations for PWIA's React+TypeScript+Tailwind stack
- 4-phase implementation plan with timeline and priorities
- Performance optimization strategies and accessibility guidelines

## Next Steps
User should review comprehensive research findings in `modernAgentUIFrameworksResearch.md` and decide on implementation priorities for PWIA UI modernization based on the 2025 framework landscape analysis.

## Status
âœ… Research Complete - Ready for user review and planning phase
