# Active Context: Day 5 Browser & Web Automation Implementation for PWIA

## Current Focus
Implementing browser automation and web interaction capabilities for the PWIA agent system. Day 4 Agent Core has been completed successfully with all tests passing. Now proceeding with browser automation components as defined in PLAN.md.

## Implementation Scope
1. **Agent Browser Module** - Playwright setup for headless and headful modes
2. **Web Crawler System** - robots.txt compliance, rate limiting, URL queue management  
3. **Data Scraper Module** - structured data extraction with CSS/XPath selectors
4. **Memory Persistence Layer** - TinyDB integration for agent state in app-memory/
5. **Browser Automation Tests** - comprehensive test suite for browser functionality

## Architecture Requirements
- **Playwright Integration** - Cross-browser automation (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- **Rate Limiting** - Respect robots.txt and implement intelligent crawling delays
- **Data Extraction** - CSS selectors, XPath, and structured data parsing
- **State Persistence** - TinyDB for visited URLs, crawl data, and session state
- **Error Recovery** - Robust error handling and retry mechanisms

## Technical Context
- **Foundation Ready**: Agent core (main.py, llm_agent.py, planner.py, confidence.py, utils.py) âœ…
- **Backend Operational**: FastAPI server with WebSocket support exists âœ…
- **Frontend Available**: React+TypeScript UI ready for integration âœ…
- **Test Framework**: 78 existing tests (71 unit + 7 integration) all passing âœ…

## Day 5 Deliverables
1. `agent/browser.py` - Playwright browser management
2. `agent/crawler.py` - Web crawling logic with compliance
3. `agent/scraper.py` - Data extraction and parsing
4. `agent/memory.py` - TinyDB persistence layer
5. `tests/agent/test_browser.py` - Browser automation tests

## Success Criteria
- Browser can launch in both headless and headful modes
- Crawler respects robots.txt and implements rate limiting
- Scraper extracts structured data using multiple selector types
- Memory system persists agent state and crawl data
- All browser tests pass with comprehensive coverage

## Integration Points
- WebSocket communication for real-time browser status updates
- Task planner integration for decomposed crawling workflows  
- Confidence scoring integration for extraction quality assessment
- LLM agent integration for intelligent data interpretation

## Status
