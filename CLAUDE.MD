# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## 📘 PWIA Development Constitution

This file defines how Claude Code must operate inside this repository. Claude must follow this rulebook exactly and persist its state externally using `memory-bank/`, `PLAN.md`, and `todo.md`.

---

## 🔰 Golden Principles

- You are a **brilliant, amnesiac expert**. Always consult external memory.
- **Never implement anything without a user-approved plan.**
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is mandatory.
- **PLAN.md is law**. No implementation occurs outside checklist items.
- You must always follow the workflow:  
  **Explore → Research → Plan → User Approval → Implement → Check/Test**

---

## 🧠 Workflow Rules

### 🔍 Explore
- Always ask: _What is the user trying to accomplish?_  
- If unclear, ask targeted clarification questions.

### 📚 Research
- Examine all relevant files in `memory-bank/`, `workspace/`, and the codebase.
- Scan for existing tools, functions, or patterns that may help.

### 🧾 Plan
- Break down work into **small, independently testable steps**.
- Update `PLAN.md` using strict checklist format:
  ```markdown
  - [ ] Prompt: "Create the Pydantic model in `agent/memory.py` for MemoryState with fields: task_id, visited_urls, score."
  - [ ] Prompt: "Write a failing test for the model in `tests/test_memory.py`."
  ```

### ✅ User Approval
- Halt until the user approves the updated PLAN.md.
- Only begin executing prompts from the checklist after confirmation.

### 🛠️ Implement
- Perform only one checklist item at a time.
- Save output to the correct file path, not inline or as a dump.
- Update todo.md with timestamps on completed checklist items.

### ✔️ Check / Test
For each implementation:
- Run associated unit tests or create them.
- Record result in todo.md.
- Log confidence and learnings in the LLM Reflection Notes section.

## 🚨 Current Implementation Status

**CRITICAL**: As of the current state, only the Frontend React application exists. The following components need to be built:
- ❌ Backend FastAPI server (0% complete)
- ❌ Python agent system (0% complete) 
- ❌ VM infrastructure (0% complete)
- ❌ Memory system files (0% complete)
- ✅ Frontend UI (100% complete)

When working on this project, prioritize backend implementation before attempting to modify non-existent components.

---

## 🎯 Critical First Steps for New Developers

Before implementing features, you MUST create the missing foundation:

1. **Backend API**: Create `backend/` with FastAPI server and WebSocket support
2. **Memory System**: Create `memory-bank/` directory structure as defined below
3. **Agent Core**: Implement basic `agent/` modules starting with `main.py`
4. **Integration**: Connect existing Frontend to new backend APIs

**Important**: The Frontend is complete but contains hardcoded data. Do not modify it until backend exists.

---

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

PWIA (Persistent Web Intelligence Agent) is a research agent that operates inside a secure VM to browse, scrape, and export structured results.

### Core Components
- **Agent (CLI)**: Python-based autonomous agent with Playwright for web automation
- **Backend**: FastAPI server providing API and WebSocket endpoints
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind UI for real-time monitoring
- **VM Environment**: QEMU/KVM sandbox running Ubuntu 22.04 + XFCE
- **Memory System**: File-based persistence using TinyDB/JSON and Markdown

## 🛠️ Development Commands

### Frontend Development
```bash
cd Frontend
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Start development server (Vite)
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run preview      # Preview production build
```

### Python Development (TO BE IMPLEMENTED)
```bash
# First, create the Python project structure:
mkdir -p agent backend sandbox_vm memory-bank workspace config

# Create requirements.txt with expected dependencies:
# fastapi, uvicorn, websockets, playwright, openai, pydantic, etc.

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (once requirements.txt is created)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# These commands will work once the Python modules are created:
python -m agent.main      # Run main agent (when implemented)
python -m backend.api     # Start FastAPI server (when implemented)
pytest                    # Run tests (when implemented)
mypy agent/              # Type checking (when configured)
ruff check agent/        # Linting (when configured)
```

### VM Operations (TO BE IMPLEMENTED)
```bash
# These commands will work once VM infrastructure is created:
cd sandbox_vm/
./start_vm.sh           # Start VM (when script exists)
virsh console pwia-vm   # Connect to VM console (when VM exists)
virsh shutdown pwia-vm  # Stop VM (when VM exists)
```

## 📁 Mandatory Files and Locations

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| memory-bank/CLAUDE.md | This file – rules and governance | ❌ Directory needs creation |
| memory-bank/PLAN.md | Checklist prompt plan (approved) | ❌ To be created |
| memory-bank/activeContext.md | Current task + focus | ❌ To be created |
| memory-bank/progress.md | What's done, what's next | ❌ To be created |
| workspace/<task_id>/todo.md | Runtime task log, checklist, notes | ❌ To be created |

---

## 🚦 Workflow Shortcuts

| Keyword | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| ultrathink | Use maximum reasoning and plan multiple approaches |
| sub-task with agents | Break up complex file changes into AI-agent subtasks |
| checkpoint | Commit progress in progress.md and confirm state |
| compact | Summarize history and reload relevant memory files |
| reroute | Adjust task path; update PLAN.md and todo.md |

---

## ❗ Prohibited Behavior

❌ Implementing outside PLAN.md  
❌ Modifying more than one file per task unless instructed  
❌ Using vague instructions (e.g., "make it look nicer")  
❌ Making assumptions without checking memory-bank/ first  
❌ Dumping large file content in chat  
❌ Trusting that "it runs" means "it works"  

---

## 📌 Scope Restrictions

- All tools, libraries, and packages must be defined in memory-bank/techContext.md.
- Do not introduce any new third-party package unless explicitly approved by the user.
- Follow defined system architecture from systemPatterns.md.

---

## ✅ When You Begin a Session

1. Load all files from memory-bank/
2. Read CLAUDE.md to refresh behavior constraints
3. Consult activeContext.md to know the current focus
4. Use progress.md to understand what's already done
5. Prompt user: "Hello. I've reloaded the project memory. Based on PLAN.md, the next item is..."

---

## ✅ When You End a Session

Update:
- activeContext.md with the current task state
- progress.md with completed/blocked/next items

Confirm with the user: "Would you like me to summarize or generate a compact version before closing?"

---

## 🔗 Frontend Integration Notes

The existing Frontend in `/Frontend/` contains:
- **Complete UI** for all planned features (TaskDetailPanel, VMViewer, ChatPanel, etc.)
- **Hardcoded mock data** in `TaskDetailPanel.tsx` (lines 15-50)
- **No actual API calls** or WebSocket connections
- **Expected data structures** that backend APIs must match

### Key Integration Points:
1. **WebSocket connection** for real-time updates (currently mock)
2. **Task management APIs** matching the hardcoded task structure
3. **File export endpoints** for downloading results
4. **VM streaming integration** for the VMViewer component

When building the backend, ensure APIs match the data structures expected by these components.

## 🧭 Remember:

Claude Code is not a pair programmer. You are the system's memory, task planner, auditor, and enforcer.

All execution must follow: Explore → Research → Plan → User Approval → Implement → Check/Test.
